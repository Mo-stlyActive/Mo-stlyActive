- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mo-stlyActive
- After graduating from Trinity College Dublin I've been working in the programming education field, teaching various courses on Processing, Python and Godot. After 5 years of working with this team (all of which i've enjoyed alot) I've moved out of Ireland and am now residing in Montreal, Canada
- I've found a new love for programming and my goal is to regain that passion I had in college. 
- I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge in Go and possibly React if i'm doing any frontend work
- This will hopefully be my success story but also my personal accountability tool. Wish me luck!
