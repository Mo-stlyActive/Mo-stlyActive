- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mo-stlyActive
- After graduating from Trinity College Dublin I ended up working in the Tech-Education space. A lot of the coding related work wasn't too intensive though and i have made this github to start fresh and upskill myself
- My goal is to enter into the software dev world!
- I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge in 3 fields. 1.Python, 2.Rush, 3.C++
- THis will hopefully be my success story but also my personal accountability tool. Wish me luck!
